## Understanding Your Hiring Pipeline

Building a hiring pipeline is one of the most critical aspects of growing a team. But how many candidates do you actually need to reach out to in order to make one hire? This calculator helps you answer that question.

### How to Read the Calculator

The calculator works **backwards from one hire**. Starting with the assumption that you want to make 1 hire, it calculates how many candidates you need at each previous stage of your pipeline based on your conversion rates.

The pipeline flows from top to bottom:
1. **Initial Outreach** - Cold emails or messages you send
2. **Response/Interest** - Candidates who reply with interest
3. **Screening Call Booked** - Candidates who schedule an initial call
4. **Take-Home Exercise** - Candidates who complete your technical assessment
5. **Team Interview** - Candidates who advance to team interviews
6. **Offer Extended** - Candidates who receive an offer
7. **Offer Accepted** - Your 1 hire (highlighted in green)

### How to Use the Calculator

The calculator compares two sourcing strategies: **Cold Outreach** and **Referrals**.

**Adjust Conversion Rates:**
- Edit the percentage fields under "Rate" for each stage
- For example, if 4% of your cold outreach gets a response, enter 4 in the Response/Interest rate field
- Each rate represents the percentage of candidates who move from that stage to the next

**Set Your Timeline:**
- Enter your target "Weeks to Hire" in the Summary Stats section
- The calculator will show you how many candidates you need to reach out to **per week** to hit your timeline
